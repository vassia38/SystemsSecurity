The canonical ubuntu:2X.yy images include the cloud-init config; at first boot, cloud-init OVERWRITES the network config:
  - there is a race when booting up, so pushing config and applying as soon as the container boots is problematic - we didn't observe this initally because in the first stage, we would launch all containers using the default lxdbr0, update packages (which takes time), then push and apply our config. But if we would want to have our custom config right from the start, just like in a more realistic environment where we don't have anywhere else to connect BUT , in this case, our firewalls, then we would have to 
    1. lxc config set <container> user.network-config="$(cat <yaml file>)"
      at first boot, our configuration is used by cloud-init
    2. use lxd images:ubuntu/x.y that are stripped of cloud-init so we can use raw netplan
